                    and settled down to a life based on farming.</h5>

                    By 2,000 years ago, much of the Earth’s population had become dependent on agriculture. 
                    Scholars are not sure why this shift to farming took place, but it may have occurred because of climate change.

                                    Fruit is the sweet, fleshy, edible part of a plant. It generally contains seeds. Fruits are usually eaten raw,
                                     although some varieties can be cooked. 
                                    They come in a wide variety of colours, shapes and flavours.</p>
