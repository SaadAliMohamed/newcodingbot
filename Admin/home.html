    <h5>Before agriculture became widespread, people spent most of their lives searching
         for food—hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. 
        About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned how to grow cereal and root crops, 
        and settled down to a life based on farming.
        By 2,000 years ago, much of the Earth’s population had become dependent on agriculture. 
        Scholars are not sure why this shift to farming took place, but it may have occurred because of climate change.</h5>
